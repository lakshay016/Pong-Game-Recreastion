# 🎮 Pong Game Recreation (Python & Pygame)

A fully functional recreation of the classic **Pong** game, built in **Python** using the **Pygame** library.  
This project was completed as part of my Grade 11 Computer Science final (ICS3U), showcasing game loop architecture, collision mechanics, UI screens, and interactive gameplay logic.

## ✨ Features

- **Classic Pong gameplay** with smooth paddle and ball movement  
- **Three difficulty modes** (Easy, Medium, Hard) with dynamic ball and paddle speeds  
- **Collision physics** for paddle hits, wall bounces, and scoring  
- **Start menu & UI screens**, including:
  - Main menu  
  - How-to-play instructions  
  - Difficulty selection  
  - Score display  
  - Win/loss screen with restart option  
- **Randomized ball serve direction** for varied gameplay  
- **AI-assisted paddle movement** for higher difficulty levels  
- **Clean modular code** using functions for game reset, movement, and event handling

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pygame** (for rendering, event handling & game loop)

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

### 1. Install Pygame
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 2. Run the game
```bash
python PONG.py
```

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Implementing a complete **game loop**  
- Managing **user input**, **collision detection**, and game states  
- Designing multiple UI screens and menus  
- Writing **modular, readable Python functions**  
- Using **Pygame** to build interactive applications

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add sound effects  
- Add multiplayer mode  
- Improve AI paddle logic  
- Add power-ups or new game modes  
- Refactor into object-oriented classes (Paddle, Ball, Game)
